### Case Study Objectives
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals.

The objective of this analysis is to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers, also known as ‘Hot Leads’ for X Education.
If we successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate would go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.
Need to build a model by assigning a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
Target is to get lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
